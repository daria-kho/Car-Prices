# Car Prices
 
 To see the notebook, open Car Prices.ipynb file
 This is a project that explores basic machine learning worflow: training - testing - optimization.
 I use a small (under 300 entries) dataset with car features to predict their prices. The algorythm I use is K-nearest neigbours that uses all the dataset for each prediction, which explains the choice of a small dataset.
